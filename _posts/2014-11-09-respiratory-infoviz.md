We know infographic is a beautiful way to present tons of (statistical) information in a single picture. If an infographic is combined with animation, the result is an **amazing** presentation.

[Table Top Whale][ttw] is a blog created by a molecular biologist who loves also web designing. There are beautiful animated biological infographics on that blog, but here is my favourite one.

Three different respiratory systems: human, bird and grasshopper:

This animation is not just a sequence of image files. This is rendered with good biological knowledge, which gives such a realistic motion. A really nice tool for teaching.
