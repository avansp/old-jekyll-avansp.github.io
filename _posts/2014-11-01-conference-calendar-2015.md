title: Imaging Conference Calendar 2015

Odd year is always busy time for cardiac imaging researchers to go for a conference. Two good bi-annual conferences occur at the same year. Would be good to split these into separate years, but it won't happen, because one is a specific cardiac imaging (FIMH) and the other is more general but mathematically oriented conference (IPMI). Both are pretty good ones if you're planning to attend. But this year FIMH & IPMI are going to be back-to-back events, from NL straight to Scotland. So if you're planning, it's a good deal.

Listing here are specific to medical image analysis, cardiac image analysis, cardiac modelling, image processing and more general computer vision conferences/workshops.
