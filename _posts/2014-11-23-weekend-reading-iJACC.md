excerpt: Is cardiac hyperthrophy good or bad? The answer is of course YES.
---

I like reading [JACC Imaging][iJACC] (iJACC) papers, because each article is accompanied by an editorial comment written by (*I assume*) an associate editor handling that article during review. Sometimes reading the editorial comment is already enough to understand the main article, which is mostly too specific on a clinical experiment. Editorial comments are easier to understand, giving more comprehensive explanation about a certain issue, provocating and entertaining.

This weekend, I read a couple of interesting editorial comments from the current issue ([vol. 7, no 11, Nov 2014][iJACCNov2014]).

## [Is Cardiac Hypertrophy Good or Bad?][Carabello2014]

Carabello wrote a nice overview on the current problem surrounding *cardiac remodeling*, a complex process of the human heart throughout its life span. I always call it as an amazing adaption of our heart to reach an equilibrium state delivering the demand of blood and oxygen supply.

Hypertrophy is not a disease. It's a condition where the heart size increases due to its mass accumulation. It can be a normal physiological process. Do you know that our heart size increases through hypertrophy 10-fold from infancy to adulthood? A trained athlete for long distance running has eccentric hypertrophy. A weight lifter generates concentric hypertrophy. So what makes hypertrophy a pathology?

It's the cardiac output. A pathology or maladaptive hypertrophy generates reduced cardiac output. A persistent maladaptive hypertrophy due to severe overload may eventually cause damage.

Then what is the current problem with hypertrophy with respect to cardiac remodeling? In the editorial comment, Carabello wrote:

> The problem is that, on a patient-by-patient comparison, we are only examining gross morphology and not the inner workings of the myocardium. It is highly unlikely that a given relative wall thickness or mass index imparts the same pathological myocardial changes (or beneficial ones) identically in all patients. But, clinically, we are in effect judging each book by its cover. Only when we begin to understand both the histologic and physiologic changes that pressure overload imparts on the specific patient of interest will we begin to answer the question: is LVH good or bad for that patient.
