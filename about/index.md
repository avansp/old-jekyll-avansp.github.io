# About This

This is (going to be) my main personal space to share my professional experience in medical imaging research. My profile is currently hosted at the [University of Auckland](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/a-suinesiaputra) or generally via [GoogleScholar](http://scholar.google.co.nz/citations?user=av3jfhgAAAAJ&hl=en).

# Contact

I try to keep social media activities bare minimum. No Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter accounts. Some are unavoidable: [Google+](https://plus.google.com/104904508082327305960) or [Research Gate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Avan_Suinesiaputra), but I rarely update or check them. The best way to contact me is via e-mail.
