This is a personal blog of Avan Suinesiaputra; sharing my professional experience in medical imaging research. My profile is currently hosted at the [University of Auckland][avan-uoa]. More generic research publication profiles are automatically generated by [GoogleScholar][avan-gscholar], the [DBLP database][avan-dblp] and [Research Gate][avan-rgate].

I'm keeping my digital social interaction to the bare minimum, so I don't have a Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site account. Best to contact me is via e-mail.
