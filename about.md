My name is Avan Suinesiaputra, currently a researcher in medical imaging. My profile is hosted at the [University of Auckland][avan-uoa]. More generic auto profiles are kindly generated by [GoogleScholar][avan-gscholar], the [DBLP database][avan-dblp] and [Research Gate][avan-rgate].

I'm keeping my digital social interaction to the bare minimum, so I don't have a Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site account. Best to contact me via e-mail.
