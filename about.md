> *I forget, therefore I blog.* -- me

Working full-time as a researcher. Currently with the [University of Auckland][avan-uoa], New Zealand. I do not have a facebook, instagram or any social media user account. I tweet under [@asui085][avan-tweeter]. There are some other about me pages provided by [ORCID][avan-orcid], [GoogleScholar][avan-gscholar], the [DBLP database][avan-dblp] and [Research Gate][avan-rgate].

This blog was setup for my personal notes.
